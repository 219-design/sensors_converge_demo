@par Example Description

How to configure the OPAMP peripheral in standalone mode. The gain
in this mode can be set externally (external gain setting mode).


   OPAMP2 is configured as following:
   - Standalone OPAMP mode is configured (as VINM is connected to OPAMP2_VOUT, OPAMP then
     operates as in follower mode (external follower)).
   - Non Inverting input is connected to DAC_OUT2 (sinevawe).
   - OPAMP Output is available on OPAMP2_VOUT (sine wave signal).
   - Push the User Push button to alternatively switch from
     normal power mode to low power mode.

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L552ZETxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q (144 pins) Set-up

    - Connect with a cable OPAMP_VINN from: pin 15 - connector CN12 (PA7 pin)
      to OPAMP_OUT2: pin 34 - connector CN11 (PB0 pin
    - Connect an oscilloscope to DAC_OUT2 from: pin 11 - connector CN12 (PA5 pin)
	    to display waveform (DAC output).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to OPAMP_OUT2: pin 34 - connector CN11 (PB0 pin)
      to display waveform (OPAMP output).
    - The OPAMP voltage output is same as VINP in both normal et low power mode.
    - In order to start test. Push the User Push button.
      Then push this User Push button again to switch from normal - low power mode


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
