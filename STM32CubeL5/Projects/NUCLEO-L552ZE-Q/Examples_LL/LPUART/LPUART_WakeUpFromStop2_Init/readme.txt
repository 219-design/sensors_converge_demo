@par Example Description
  
Configuration of GPIO and LPUART peripherals to allow characters 
received on LPUART_RX pin to wake up the MCU from low-power mode. This example is based 
on the LPUART LL API. The peripheral initialization uses LL 
initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

LPUART Peripheral is configured in asynchronous mode (9600 bauds, 8 data bit, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity).
No HW flow control is used.
LPUART Clock is based on HSI.

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, LED1 is blinking quickly during 3 sec,
then MCU  enters "Stop 2" mode (LED1 off).
On first  character reception by the LPUART from PC Com port (ex: using HyperTerminal)
after "Stop 2" Mode period, MCU wakes up from "Stop 2" Mode.
Received character value is checked :
- On a specific value ('S' or 's'), LED1 is turned On and program ends.
- If different from 'S' or 's', program performs a quick LED1 blinks during 3 sec and 
  enters again "Stop 2" mode, waiting for next character to wake up.

In case of errors, LED1 is slowly blinking (1 sec period).

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L552ZETxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q Set-up
    - Connect STM32 MCU board to PC with USB ST link in order to use ST link virtual COM port.
    - Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or TeraTerm) with proper configuration 
      (9600 bauds, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, no parity, no HW flow control). 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
