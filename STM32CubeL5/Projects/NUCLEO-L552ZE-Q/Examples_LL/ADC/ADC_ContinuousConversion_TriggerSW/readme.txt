@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform continuous ADC conversions on a 
channel, from a software start.
This example is based on the STM32L5xx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.

Example execution:
From the first press on User push-button, the ADC converts the selected channel
continuously.
After the first trigger (software start in this example), following conversions
are launched successively automatically, indefinitely.
Software polls for the first conversion completion
and stores it into a variable, LED1 is turned on.
Main program reads frequently ADC conversion data 
(without waiting for end of each conversion: software reads data 
when main program execution pointer is available and can let 
some ADC conversions data unread and overwritten by newer data)
and stores it into the same variable.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

LED1 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error. 
 
Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User push-button
  1 GPIO for LED1
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN7 pin 9, Morpho connector CN11 pin 32)

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.
