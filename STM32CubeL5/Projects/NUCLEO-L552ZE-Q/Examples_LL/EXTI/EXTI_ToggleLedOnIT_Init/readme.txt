@par Example Description

How to configure the EXTI and use GPIOs to toggle the user LEDs
available on the board when a user button is pressed. This example is 
based on the STM32L5xx LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL initialization functions to demonstrate LL init usage.

In this example, one EXTI line (External line 13) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.

In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - External line 13 is connected to PC.13 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on External line 13 by pressing User push-button, LED1 toggles

On NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q:
    - External line 13 is connected to User push-button

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L552ZETxQ devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
