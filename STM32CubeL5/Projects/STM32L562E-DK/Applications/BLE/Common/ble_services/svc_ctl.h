/**
 * The BLE Controller supports the application to handle services and clients.
 * It provides an API to initialize the BlueNRG Device and a handler mechanism to rout the GATT/GAP events to the
 * application. When the ble_controller is used (recommended), the application shall register a callback for each
 * Service and each Client implemented. This is already done with the Services and Clients provided in that delivery.
 *  + A GATT event is relevant to only one Service and/or one Client. When a GATT event is received, it is notified to
 *    the registered handlers to the BLE controller. When no registered handler acknowledges positively the GATT event,
 *    it is reported to the application.
 *  + A GAP event is not relevant to either a Service or a Client. It is sent to the application
 *  + In case the application does not want to take benefit from the ble_controller, it could bypass it. In that case,
 *  the application shall:
 *    - call  SVCCTL_Init() to initialize the BlueNRG device (or implement on its own what is inside that function
 *    - implement TLHCI_UserEvtRx() which is the notification from the HCI layer to report all events (GATT/GAP).
